The repository contains the conformance suite for the old deprecated (pre-FAPI-alignment)
OpenBanking UK security profile. These tests will be retired and no
longer available after September 2019.

Please see https://gitlab.com/openid/conformance-suite and
https://www.certification.openid.net/ for the latest
non-deprecated OpenBanking tests.
